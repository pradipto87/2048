# 2048 Game: Console-Based Implementation in C#

## Overview

This project is a console-based version of the popular game 2048, implemented in C#. It currently supports two types of players:
1. **Human Player**: In this mode, the game will prompt for your input at each step, allowing you to control the game's progression.
2. **Random Player**: This mode offers an automated gameplay experience, where the direction of each move is chosen randomly by the game itself.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Intelligent Agents**: We plan to introduce AI players that can play the game optimally.
2. **Player Comparisons**: A feature to compare the performance of different players
